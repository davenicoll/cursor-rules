# Guardrail Package Dependencies

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- Applied when adding a new package dependency in Node.js, Python, C#, Java, or Ruby
- Ensures third-party package reliability and maturity

## Requirements
- Before implementation, query the official package repository for the target language:
  - Node.js (npm): https://registry.npmjs.org/
  - Python (PyPI): https://pypi.org/project/
  - C# (NuGet): https://www.nuget.org/packages/
  - Java (Maven Central): https://search.maven.org/artifact/
  - Ruby (RubyGems): https://rubygems.org/gems/
- Confirm the package exists, never assume it does
- Check the package's initial release date and ensure it is at least one month old
- If checks fail, abort the operation and ask the user how to proceed

## Critical Rules

<critical>
- ALWAYS verify package existence before proceeding
- NEVER allow packages younger than one month to be installed
- ALWAYS abort and alert the user on failure
</critical>
