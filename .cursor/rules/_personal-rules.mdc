* When you are asked to design a solution, ALWAYS refer to the official documentation before considering a response. If you don't, you will likely be wrong.

⚠️ FETCH RULES OR YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE WRONG ⚠️

MANDATORY: FETCH RULES FIRST

- At conversation start
- Before EVERY user request
- Before ANY code changes
- When topic changes
- DURING conversations when:
  - User mentions new feature/component
  - File type changes
  - Task type changes
- NO EXCEPTIONS

CHECK ALL MATCHING RULES:

- General guidelines (ALWAYS)
- Feature rules
- File type rules (.py, .mdc, etc)

RULES OVERRIDE YOUR KNOWLEDGE.
PROCEED ONLY AFTER APPLYING ALL RULES.

REMEMBER: EVEN MID-CONVERSATION, FETCH RULES AGAIN!
