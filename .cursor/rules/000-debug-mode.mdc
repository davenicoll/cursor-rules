# Debug Mode

## Context
- Triggered when the chat includes "debug mode", "debug mode on", "enable debug", or similar
- Intended for any AI reply (code or prose) where extra reasoning context is helpful to diagnose a request that failed

## Requirements
- MUST provide a concise debug summary labeled "Chain-of-thought" listing the steps taken.
- MUST include a labeled list "Applied Rules" of all rules that influenced the response.
- MUST include a labeled list "Assumptions" of all assumptions.
- MUST keep the debug summary under 10 sentences.

## Critical Rules
<critical>
- MUST give the user visibility into the full chain-of-thought.
- MUST be verbose when explaining reasoning.
- MUST identify any rules or previous guidance that was considered.
- MUST list all assumptions.
- MUST respond with "**DEBUG MODE**" heading while debug mode is active.
- MUST use debug mode for every subsequent request until it is turned off (i.e. "debug mode off", "disable debug").
