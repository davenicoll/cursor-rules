# Cursor Rules

This repository serves as a style guide for implementing Cursor rules. It consolidates rules for naming conventions, clean code principles, version management, and project-specific architectural guidelines. These rules aim to guide Cursor's AI to more predictable, reliable answers.

See here https://davenicoll.com/getting-started-with-ai-assisted-coding/ for how to use these rules.

## Cursor Setup

The fastest way to start using rules in Cursor is to either symlink the `.cursor` folder or copy the entire `.cursor` folder into the root of your repository containing code. Cursor will automatically apply the rules in your next chat session.
