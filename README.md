# Cursor Rules

I created this repo as a style guide for Cursor rules—covering naming conventions, clean-code practices, version management, language-specific rules, and architecture guidelines. The goal is to steer Cursor’s AI toward more consistent, reliable outputs.

See https://davenicoll.com/getting-started-with-ai-assisted-coding/ for how to use these rules.

## Cursor Setup

The fastest way to start using rules in Cursor is to either symlink the `.cursor` folder or copy the entire `.cursor` folder into the root of your repository containing code. Cursor will automatically apply the rules in your next chat session.
